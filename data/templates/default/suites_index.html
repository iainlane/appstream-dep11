    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the DEP-11 generator HTML pages!</p>
    <p>
      These pages exist to provide a user-friendly view on the issues discovered by the
      DEP-11 generator while extracting metadata from packages in the {{distro}} archive.
      They can also be used to take a look at the raw metadata, to spot possible problems
      with the data itself or the generation process.

    <h1>What is DEP-11 and AppStream?</h1>
    <p>
      AppStream is a cross-distro XML format to provide metadata for software components and to assign unique identifiers to software.<br/>
      In Debian, we parse all XML provided by upstream projects as well as other metadata (.desktop-files, ...), and compile a single YAML
      metadata file from it, which is then shipped to users via APT.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the official AppStream specification is based on XML, Debian uses a YAML version of the format for easier use in existing
      scripts and for better archive integration. This format is called DEP-11, and initially had a much wider scope in enhancing
      archive metadata than AppStream had. Today AppStream covers that as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The generated metadata can for example be used by software centers like GNOME-Software or KDE Discover to display a user-friendly application-centric
      way on the package archive.
    </p>

      See <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/AppStream">AppStream @ wiki.d.o</a> for information about AppStream integration and usage in Debian.<br/>
      The offical AppStream specification can be found at <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/">freedesktop.org</a>, a description
      of the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/sect-AppStream-DEP11.html">DEP-11 YAML format</a> is hosted there as well.
