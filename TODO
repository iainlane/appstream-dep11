= DEP-11 Data Extractor TODO List =

=== Known issues ===

 * The extractor can't get a list of files for certain .deb packages, see
   'qtwebkit-opensource-src/libqt5webkit5-dbg_5.4.2+dfsg-3_amd64.deb' as an example.
   Might be an issue with python-apt, some multiprocessing insanity leading to this
   happening sometimes, or could even be a problem with the package itself.
   This issue happens only rarely.
 * Some icon-themes use an "unusual" directory layout, we need to read the theme index
   file to process them. Examples are the Elementary and Breeze themes.

=== Planned Features ===

 * Extract localizstion status for AppStream components and add them as
   `Languages` field.
 * Extract more metadata from things which do not have AppStream upstream
   metadata yet.
 * Add an icon-cache so we don't render SVG icons in themes multiple times.

=== Whishlist / Random Ideas ===

 * Maybe pre-filter for interesting packages based on Contents.gz
   to speed up the generator.
